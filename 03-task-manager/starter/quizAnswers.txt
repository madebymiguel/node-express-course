In an Express application middleware is a function that executes during the request-response cycle and has access to the request and response objects and next function. It can execute any code, change request and or response objects.

2. What does CRUD stand for?

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. It's the four basic operations that can be performed on data stored in a database or application.

3. You are careful to store your sensitive information in a .env file.

  1. How do you get your app to access the information in the .env file?

  To get your Express app to access information in the .env file, you use a package like dotenv. This package loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env

  2. How do you protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored in your github repository?

    You add the .env file to your .gitignore file so git doesn't track the file and prevents it from being committed to your repository.
